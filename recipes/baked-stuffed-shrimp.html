            <p>This baked stuffed shrimp recipe was created by my late mother over 30 years ago. My grandparents, father, and I have enjoyed these stuffed shrimp every other Friday for many years. We've made them without scallops sometimes due to price. Serve with melted butter or freshly squeezed lemon along with a garden salad and rice pilaf or baked potato.</p>
