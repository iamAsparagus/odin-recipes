        <h2>Hotdog Rollup on plate</h2>
        <p>Just when  you thought hot dogs couldn't get more fun, here's a tasty new twist.
            These bite-sized snacks are not only easy to make, but they're also loaded with 
            all your favorite hot dog finxin's: Cheddar chase, tangy mustard, crunch onions, 
            and a touch of sweet pickle relish.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>8 (1oz) slices white bread</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
            <li>8 beef hot dogs</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons minced yellow onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. Trim just the 
                crust off each bread slice, forming a 4x4-inch square. Spread each bread slice 
                with an even layer of mustard (about 3/4 teaspoon per slice).</li>
            <li>Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice on the edge 
                of the bread closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally on top of the cheese slice. 
                If needed, trim the ends of the hot dog so that no hot dog extends over edges of bread. 
                Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons onion horizontally across the cheese slice above the hot dog, 
                followed by 1 teaspoon of relish.</li>
            <li>Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. 
                Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces (about 1 1/4-inches each), and transfer to a 
                serving platter. Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer 
                to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's 
                instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of roll-ups with cooking spray. Working 
                in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket, spacing them 1/2-inch apart, and cook until 
                bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir together barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until 
                evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Serve hotdog roll-ups with mayonnaise mixture.</li>
        </ol>
